=======================================================
TODO Add to all modules: 'use experimental :rakustest;' 
=======================================================

Once I'm happy with all tests, dup all tests and rename to
indicate using RakuAST:

    use experimental :rakuast;

================================
TODO Fix proper handling if able
================================

Note the following types of pod are not yet handled
completely according to the current docs:

=defn

=para

=item

For consistency, we try to ensure most tests are done
wrapped in =begin/=end pairs as well as in standalone 
pieces.  Until RakuAST is fully integrated, that may 
not be possible in all cases.

========================
TODO Build new repo file
========================

Generate a new module for 'Pod::TreeWalker::Listener'
which uses the ListenerRole and should try to use all the
known Pod classes.

If workable, ensure this distro gets either a new API 
or version 2.0.0+ or maybe both. Ask #raku.

=======================
DONE Rename a repo file
=======================

AFTER existing tests are good, consider a major rename:
   
rename: lib/Pod/TreeWalker/Listener.rakumod (a unit role)
to      lib/Pod/TreeWalker/ListenerRole.rakumod (a unit role)
