Rename repo files:
=================

AFTER tests are good, consider a major rename:
   
   rename: lib/Pod/TreeWalker/Listener.rakumod (a unit role)
   to      lib/Pod/TreeWalker/Listen.rakumod (a unit role)

   rename: t/lib/TestListener.rakumod (a unit class does Listen)
   to:     lib/Pod/TreeWalker/Listener.rakumod (a unit class does Listen)

If workable, ensure its gets either a new API or version 2 or
maybe both. Ask #raku.
   
Fix proper handling if able:
===========================
Note the following types of pod are not yet handled
completely according to the current docs:

=defn

=para

=item

For consistency, we try to ensure most tests are done
wrapped in =begin/=end pairs as well as in standalone pieces.
Until RakuAST is fully integrated, that may
not be possible in all cases.

Once I'm happy with all tests, dup all tests and rename to
indicate using RakuAST:

    use experimental :rakuast;
